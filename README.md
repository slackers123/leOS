# Leo(s) - a small os/system-dev experimentation project
The leo project is a combination of the LeOS operating system and
programs/libraries written for said operating system.

## Why?
For fun.

## What?
Anything that interest me.

## What exactly?
Currently the project is still extremely immature. Right now the
only things that exist are:
- leos-libs: libraries comprising basic functionality and just experiments in general
  - corelib: some basic functions and types used throughout the other libraries
  - drawlib: drawing of shapes onto a generic target
  - htmllib: html tokenizer still missing a parser
  - mathlib: a collection of mathematical primitives and functions
  - parserlib: small generalized parsing of a buffer
  - regexlib: very basic regex parser and engine
  - ttflib: loading glyphs from a TrueType font file
- leos-kernel: a small kernel written in rust based on the bootboot bootloader (should be deprecated)
- gui_experiments: native bootstrapping for testing drawlib etc.
